	<h1>Ingredients</h1>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="scale" num="100"></span>g salted butter</li>
		<li><span class="scale" num="3"></span> tbsp golden syrup</li>
		<li><span class="scale" num="100"></span>g dark muscovado sugar</li>
		<li><span class="scale" num="0.5"></span> tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
		<li><span class="scale" num="1"></span> tbsp ground ginger</li>
		<li><span class="scale" num="1"></span> tsp ground cinnamon</li>
		<li><span class="scale" num="255"></span>g plain flour</li>
		<li><span class="scale" num="50"></span>g icing sugar</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>Method</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Heat the butter, syrup and sugar together in a small pan until melted, stirring occasionally.
			Set aside to cool slightly.</li>
		<li>Mix together the bicarb, ginger, cinnamon and flour in a large bowl.
			Pour in the buttery syrup mixture and stir to combine, then use your hands to bring together to form a dough.
			Add up to <span class="scale" num="1"></span> tbsp of milk to combine if needed.
			The dough will be soft at this point, but it’ll firm up in the fridge.</li>
		<li>Put the dough on a sheet of baking parchment, shape into a rectangle, and lay another sheet of parchment on top of it.
			Roll the dough out to a thickness of ½cm.
			Transfer to a baking sheet to keep it flat, leaving the parchment in place, then chill in the fridge for 1 hr.</li>
		<li>Heat the oven to 190°C/170°C fan/Gas 5 and line a large baking sheet with more baking parchment.
			Remove the dough from the fridge and cut out shapes using a cookie cutter.</li>
		<li>Place the shapes, spread apart, on the lined baking sheet, and bake for 10-12 mins.
			Leave to cool completely on the baking sheet.</li>
		<li>Meanwhile, mix the icing sugar with <span class="scale" num="1"></span>–<span class="scale" num="2"></span> tbsp water.
			You want to create a consistency that’s thick and pipeable, and not too thin or it will run.
			Decorate the cooled biscuits with the icing using a piping bag with a thin nozzle.</li>
