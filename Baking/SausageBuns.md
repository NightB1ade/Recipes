# Method

1. Put ½ portion of the flour and yeast in a bowl and combine
1. Add the sugar and salt and mix well
1. Pour the egg and milk mixture into the bowl
1. Use a large spoon (or pastry scraper) to mix everything together
1. Put the remaining ½ portion of the flour into the bowl and knead briefly to combine all the ingredients
1. Take the dough out of the bowl and knead
1. The dough will become elastic after kneading for about 5 minutes
1. Add the butter and knead the dough for 5-10 minutes or until the dough is soft, pliable, smooth and slightly shiny, almost satiny
1. You can also try stretching part of the dough, if it stretches into a thin sheet without breaking, the dough is ready
1. Put the dough into a lightly buttered bowl and cover with a damp cloth
1. Let the dough rise in a warm place until its size doubles (1-1½ hour depending on the room temperature)
1. Take the dough out of the bowl, deflate it by touching lightly
1. Cut the dough into <span class="scale" num="8"></span> pieces, roll into a ball, cover with a damp cloth and let them rest for 10 minutes
1. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into long cylinders, about 40cm in length (depends on the length of the sausage)
1. Roll to enclose the sausage, with the end of the dough facing down
1. Place the rolls on a tray lined with parchment paper
1. Cover the rolls and let it rise until it doubles in size
1. Brush lightly with some milk
1. Preheat oven to 200°C and bake for about 10-12 minutes or until the rolls turn light brown
1. You may cover the rolls with aluminium foil to prevent browning
