	<ol>
		<li>Put ½ portion of the flour and yeast in a bowl and combine</li>
		<li>Add the sugar and salt and mix well</li>
		<li>Pour the egg and milk mixture into the bowl</li>
		<li>Use a large spoon (or pastry scraper) to mix everything together</li>
		<li>Put the remaining ½ portion of the flour into the bowl and knead briefly to combine all the ingredients</li>
		<li>Take the dough out of the bowl and knead</li>
		<li>The dough will become elastic after kneading for about 5 minutes</li>
		<li>Add the butter and knead the dough for 5-10 minutes or until the dough is soft, pliable, smooth and slightly shiny, almost satiny</li>
		<li>You can also try stretching part of the dough, if it stretches into a thin sheet without breaking, the dough is ready</li>
		<li>Put the dough into a lightly buttered bowl and cover with a damp cloth</li>
		<li>Let the dough rise in a warm place until its size doubles (1-1½ hour depending on the room temperature)</li>
		<li>Take the dough out of the bowl, deflate it by touching lightly</li>
		<li>Cut the dough into <span class="scale" num="8"></span> pieces, roll into a ball, cover with a damp cloth and let them rest for 10 minutes</li>
		<li>Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into long cylinders, about 40cm in length (depends on the length of the sausage)</li>
		<li>Roll to enclose the sausage, with the end of the dough facing down</li>
		<li>Place the rolls on a tray lined with parchment paper</li>
		<li>Cover the rolls and let it rise until it doubles in size</li>
		<li>Brush lightly with some milk</li>
		<li>Preheat oven to 200°C and bake for about 10-12 minutes or until the rolls turn light brown</li>
		<li>You may cover the rolls with aluminium foil to prevent browning</li>
