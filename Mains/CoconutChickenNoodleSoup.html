		<li><span class="scale" num="4"></span> nests medium egg noodles</li>
		<li><span class="scale" num="6"></span> spring onions, chopped</li>
		<li><span class="scale" num="400"></span>ml/<span class="scale" num="14"></span>fl oz low-fat coconut milk</li>
		<li><span class="scale" num="400"></span>ml/<span class="scale" num="14"></span>fl oz chicken stock made with <span class="scale" num="1"></span>× stock cube</li>
		<li><span class="scale" num="2"></span>-<span class="scale" num="3"></span> chicken thighs or drumsticks, skin removed</li>
		<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>Method</h1>
	<ol>
		<li>Boil the kettle.
			Break up the noodles and put into a bowl.
			Cover with boiling water, set aside, and allow the noodles to soften completely – about 10 minutes.</li>
		<li>Meanwhile, add the white part of the spring onion to a saucepan with the coconut milk, stock, and a twist of black pepper.
			Bring to a simmer, add the chicken thighs, and cook for 15-20 minutes.
			Don’t boil it or the chicken will be tough and the coconut milk will separate (if you use boneless chicken thighs, simmer for 8-10 minutes).
			Season with pepper.</li>
		<li>Remove the chicken from the saucepan and check that it is completely cooked.
			If it’s pink near the bone, return it to the stock for another 5 minutes.
			When cooked, set the chicken thighs aside to cool slightly.</li>
		<li>Drain the noodles and add them to the coconut liquid.
			Chop the chicken from the bone and stir into the soup with the green part of the spring onion.</li>
