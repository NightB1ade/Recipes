# Ingredients

- <span class="scale" num="3"></span>g active dry yeast
- <span class="scale" num="180"></span>ml warm water
- <span class="scale" num="270"></span>g plain flour
- <span class="scale" num="120"></span>g corn flour
- <span class="scale" num="65"></span>g sugar
- <span class="scale" num="60"></span>ml vegetable oil
- <span class="scale" num="2.5"></span> tsp (<span class="scale" num="10"></span>g) baking powder
- <span class="scale" num="1"></span>-<span class="scale" num="2"></span> tsp water (optional)
- <span class="scale" num="300"></span>g char siu, finely chopped

# Method

1. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, dissolve the yeast in the warm water
1. Sift together the flour and corn flour, and add it to the yeast mixture along with the sugar and oil
1. Turn on the mixer to the lowest setting and let it go until a smooth dough ball is formed
1. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 2 hours
1. After your dough has rested for 2 hours, add the baking powder to the dough and turn the mixer on to the lowest setting.  At this point, if the dough looks dry or you’re having trouble incorporating the baking powder, add <span class="scale" num="1"></span>-<span class="scale" num="2"></span> teaspoons water
1. Gently knead the dough until it becomes smooth again
1. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for another 15 minutes
1. Meanwhile, cut baking paper into <span class="scale" num="10"></span> 2x2 inch squares
1. Prepare your steamer by bringing the water to a boil
1. Now we are ready to assemble the buns: roll the dough into a long tube and divide it into <span class="scale" num="10"></span> equal pieces
1. Press each piece of dough into a disc about 4.5 inches in diameter (it should be thicker in the centre and thinner around the edges)
1. Add some filling and pleat the buns until they’re closed on top
1. Place each bun on a baking paper square
1. Once the water boils, place the buns in the steamer (2 at a time) and steam each batch for 12 minutes over high heat
